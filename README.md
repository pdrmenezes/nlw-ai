Inspired by @rocketseat's NLW AI Mastery

Fullstack app to help people with hearing disabilities to generate video transcripts. The user can upload an .mp4 video and with OpenAI's ChatGPT help, the app generates a transcript for the entire video.

### This project was created with:

- Next.js 13.4
- React 18
- OpenAI's ChatGPT API
- Bun v1.0
- Tailwind
- Radix UI
- Shadcn UI
- Fastify
- Node.js
- WebAssembly (FFmpeg) to help convert video to audio to generate the transcript

### Improvements

- Use Next.js API routes and the stream data from it
